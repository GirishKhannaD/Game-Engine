# Game-Engine
A modular 2D game engine built in C++ using advanced ECS architecture (Big Array, Archetypes, Packed Arrays) and game programming patterns.

This project is the final coursework for the ECS7014P Advanced Game Development module. It implements a fully-featured 2D game engine using multiple Entity-Component-System architectures (Big Array, Archetypes, Packed Arrays), along with design patterns such as Command, Observer, Flyweight, and Service Locator. Features include runtime entity spawning, TTL handling, sprite animation, collision callbacks, and keybinding toggle support. Designed for modularity, performance, and scalability.
